<p>Prohibit usage of invokeLater

<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    Usage of SwingUtilities.invokeLater is prohibited in the code base,
    it could be too late to perform the runnable but there is no convenient
    API to check if that's the case (like the initial dialog is still shown,
    no progress window appeared since the activity was requested, etc.)
